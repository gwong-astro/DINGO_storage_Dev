# DINGO storage Development
DINGO storage system development

A major challenge for any deep astronomical survey is the storage of large files generated from the instruments such as ASKAP and in the near future SKA.  This repository possesses the scripts in taking the UV-grids generated from ASKAPsoft, the system required to store the data and metadata, and importing it into the DINGO pipeline.  This project is carried as a part of the ADACS long term support program (2019/2020).
